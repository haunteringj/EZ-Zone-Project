/**
 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can

 *
 * For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we preserve
 * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we
 * reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN
 *
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * SetMutation        NoDocument(v3)        Document(v0)
 * SetMutation        InvalidDocument(v0)   Document(v0)
 * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)

 * DeleteMutation     InvalidDocument(v0)   NoDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set and Patch mutations. As deletes have no
 * explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we transition to an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us
 * the updated version.
 *
 * Field transforms are used only with Patch and Set Mutations. We use the
 * `updateTransforms` message to store transforms, rather than the `transforms`s
 * messages.
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes
 *
